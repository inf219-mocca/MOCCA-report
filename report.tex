\begin{abstract}
  One of the challenges facing students at the informatics department at the
  University of Bergen is knowing whether there is fresh coffee available in the
  study hall or not. Students often lose valuable study time by walking over to
  the coffee maker, only to discover that the pot is empty or that the coffee is
  cold. In this report, we present \textsc{mocca}: MOCCA Operational Controller
  for Coffee Availability, an Internet of Things coffee brewer accessory
  designed to address this issue. Specifically, \textsc{mocca} enables students
  to visit a website and immediately know the amount of remaining coffee, its
  temperature, and its age.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
At our study hall our most prized possession is probably our drip coffee
machine. It is a valuable piece of comfort that the students have, and is used
every day from early in the morning until the last student goes home. As
students, the biggest problem with the brewer is that you can never be sure when
there is coffee available, and whenever there is none left you waste precious
minutes sitting in the couch waiting for it to finish brewing. There have been
many attempts at solving this problem throughout the years, none of which have
survived past the prototyping phase. This project breaks the chain and have a
working product that can withstand the test of time.

In this report, we present \textsc{mocca}: MOCCA Operational Controller for
Coffee Availability, a system for measuring both the temperature, age, and
quantity of coffee. It orchestrates a \textsc{rest api}, which is a stateless
web service that allows clients to make \textsc{http} requests to our server
using predefined \textsc{url} endpoints representing the data our system has
stored. If a request is valid the server responds with the requested data, and
if the request is not valid or did not succeed information about why not. Our
\textsc{api} gives information about the temperature of the coffee, how old the
brew is, and an estimate of the amount of coffee remaining. In turn this
\textsc{api} is then used to display this information on a website.

\textsc{mocca} achieves this by combining a contact-less infrared temperature
sensor and an electrical current sensor connected to an Arduino Uno and a camera
connected to a Raspberry Pi, which also doubles as our data cruncher. Measuring
temperature is fairly straight-forward with an infrared sensor. Calculating the
age of the brew is a bit trickier as it involves monitoring the amount of
current the brewer is drawing. A coffee brewer has essentially three states:
turned off, brewing, and warming. By combining time stamps and the current, we
can calculate when a new brew is started and how old any given brew is. Quantity
is measured by image processing. Images are taken of the coffee pot and we
estimate the amount of coffee remaining by counting the number of dark
pixels,while accounting for the background of the pot.

This approach has the benefit of giving the students near our study hall
real-time information about the drip brewer. Students are still able to use the
brewer as usual without any interference from our product. A hard requirement is
that our solution must be non-intrusive, we cannot interfere or take apart the
brewer, nor can we sacrifice the ease of access and use for it.

The remainder of the report is organized as follows: section
\ref{sec:system-overview} is an overview as well as a technical description of
the system and its various subsystems. In Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we give
our concluding remarks. Section \ref{sec:future-work} contains future work,
ending with acknowledgements in section \ref{sec:acknowledgements}.

\section{System overview}\label{sec:system-overview}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centerfloat{}
  \scalebox{.75}{\input{architecture.tex}}
  \caption{An overview of the system architecture for \textsc{mocca}. There are
    two physically separate systems, an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi. The data
    collection subsystem uses both for taking a snapshot of the coffee at a
    given point in time. This data is passed to the data processing subsystems
    which transforms and stores this data, finally passing it on to the serving
    subsystem which serves this data to our \textsc{api}, and serves our website.
  }\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}
\textsc{mocca} is composed of three subsystems that are responsible for
collecting sensor data, processing and storing this data and presenting the data
to the user, respectively. See figure \ref{fig:architecture}. It is written in
Django, a high-level web framework for Python. The subsystems live together in
the application as three separate applications that pass data between them, and
is therefore quite complex. The subsystems are intricately linked and care has
been taken to ensure that one system crashing or stopping cannot bring down the
whole application.

\subsection{Data collection}\label{sec:data-collection}
The first subsystem is the data collection system. It consists of an 
infrared sensor measuring the temperature of the coffee, a current sensor 
measuring current to determine the state of the brewer and a camera pointed 
towards the coffee for measuring amount of coffee. The two first sensors are 
controlled by the Arduino micro controller while the camera is connected to the 
Raspberry Pi.

\subsubsection{Arduino}\label{sec:arduino}
Our code on the Arduino runs in a loop, continuously reading from its sensors,
saving the data to a queue. The Arduino continuously adds to the queue,
discarding the last item in it for every reading, and waits for the Raspberry Pi
to send a predetermined message saying that it is ready for data. This queue
prevents the Raspberry Pi from reading data in the middle of a write to the
serial interface, a communication interface that transmits data using a stream
of bits. Once the Arduino receives this message it enters a write-mode and
fetches the latest reading from the queue, returns it, clears the queue and
exits the current state returning to reading data.

\subsubsection{Raspberry Pi}\label{sec:raspberry-pi}
The Raspberry Pi 3+ is a small computer equipped with \textsc{usb},
\textsc{hdmi}, \textsc{wi-fi}, and, most important for us, support for a camera.
Though lacking in computational power, its size and affordability makes it a
perfect data cruncher for our case as it can fit in a compact container near the
drip coffee brewer. The camera used is the Raspberry Pi Foundation's own camera
module, a simple plug-and-play camera. We only need a rough estimate of the
quantity of coffee, and therefore the resolution for the camera is reduced to
\(630 \times 360\) pixels, reducing the computational load on our Raspberry Pi.

\subsection{Data processing}\label{sec:data-processing}
The data processing subsystem is the core of our application. This subsystem
runs in the background as an asynchronous queue, collecting data from the data
collection subsystem every ten seconds, processing and storing it. Most of the
heavy lifting here is done in NumPy, a high-performance library for scientific
computing with Python. Once an image has been captured by our camera it is
transformed into a matrix of boolean values based on a threshold for brightness.
Thanks to the excellent performance given by NumPy, even the limited computing
power of the Raspberry Pi is no concern.

The temperature and power draw is simply read from the Arduino without any
processing necessary. This is not to say that we simply take the values and
insert them into our database, we still need to verify that the data that was
returned is valid data in our current state and what to do with it. There are a
number of moving parts, variables and possible states that we need to ensure are
all in sync and valid, requiring sophisticated error handling. How does the
subsystem know that the current state of the world is in order? As we are
processing data we need to determine if the data that was read and received
matches our current expected state and values, while also ensuring that the
possible causes of this does not cause the system to enter a state where no
further data will be valid. This is achieved by various safety checks, and with
data validation. Since the system runs on a ten second loop, our solution to
invalid data is to discard the current reading and wait for the next one.
Because the intervals between reading data is as short as it is, we deemed it
fine to wait ten seconds for the next reading.

For instance, the coffee machine can be powered off by two different parts: its
own power supply or the socket that it is connected to as both these run on
separate timers. This is simple enough, if there is no power going through the
current sensor we know that there's an outage and update the state of the brew
accordingly. If the temperature of the coffee is hotter than the brewer can
possibly achieve, we discard it. Or, if the temperature from the latest reading
to the one being processed is above our threshold for valid swings in
temperature, we discard it and wait for the next.

If our current assumed state is that the machine is keeping the coffee warm, a
reading where the temperature suddenly changes can for example be that someone
has taken away the carafe to fill a cup. These are just some of the scenarios
that the data processing layer needs to work around. The sensors are ---
essentially --- our interface to the real world, but the real world does not
always behave as we think it will. We have accounted for the various possible
causes of invalid states and together with error handling and validity checks
this ensures that the system will only store valid data.

\subsection{Data serving}\label{sec:data-serving}
The final subsystem is the user facing subsystem, where we serve the data that
we have gathered and processed. This subsystem consists of two parts, one
back-end and one front-end. The back-end is our \textsc{api}, a web service that
a user an query to get data from either the latest reading or the 25 last
readings. This \textsc{api} is also consumed by our front-end, a web application
that continuously queries the \textsc{api} and displays the current state in a
human readable form.

\subsection{Back-end}\label{sec:back-end}
The back-end exposes the data collected and processed by our previous two
subsystems as an \textsc{api} that can be queried and consumed by other
applications. Due to the constraints put on the system we need to run the data
fetching in the background in an asynchronous task runner as we could not have
the user facing part of the system lock itself up while it was processing the
data. The processed data is available on predefined endpoints that are listed in
the automatically generated documentation for our \textsc{api}, allowing users
to interactively explore and see what is available and how to query the data.

\subsection{Front-end}\label{sec:front-end}

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/brewing}
  }
  \caption{Examples of various states of the brew represented on the website.}\label{fig:website}
\end{figure}
The front-end is a web application, separate from the previous subsystems, that
users can visit in their web browser and instantly see the current state of the
coffee. We decided early on using React, a JavaScript library for building web
application, due to its popularity as a learning experience. Some examples of
the web application can be seen in figure \ref{fig:website}. The web application
shares some characteristics with the back-end in that it automatically attempts
to fetch the latest data from the \textsc{api} every ten seconds.

When a user visits the web application they are presented with an overview page
listing the current state of the coffee. These states are represented by an icon
showing the current amount of coffee or if it is without power and two lines of
flavor text explaining how the brew is doing and whether it is safe to go grab a
cup right now. For example, if the coffee is nearly empty the icon is a coffee
carafe that is nearly empty, and the user is told that ``you better run'' to
emphasize that you need to grab the coffee with due haste. A history page is
also included if the user wants to see the trends for the coffee. This page
lists the last 25 readings of the brewer, allowing the user to at a glance see
how the coffee has been doing for the last few minutes.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We have created a system that successfully monitors the coffee in a drip coffee
brewer. Current and infrared temperature sensors connected to an Arduino gather
information about the age and temperature of the coffee. The temperature and
current is then sent to a Raspberry Pi via an \textsc{usb} serial interface.
Using a camera connected to the Raspberry Pi, we capture images of the coffee
pot to measure the amount of coffee in the container. Processing this data in
turn gives us an insight in the temperature, age, and quantity of the coffee.
These sensor are non-intrusive, as to not discourage the students from brewing
and drinking that sweet coffee. A Django \textsc{rest api} then presents
temperature, age and amount to the outside world enabling others to create their
own interface and representation of what the state of the coffee is. For others
we have created a website to make it accessible for the masses.
 
\section{Future work}\label{sec:future-work}
\textsc{mocca} successfully allows users to both at a glance see the state of
the coffee and build their own applications on top of this. The system currently
has no proper case, and this is the biggest and most pressing future work item.
We would like to 3D-print a case that can contain both the Raspberry Pi, Arduino
and easily aim the sensors. This is something that we would like to be able to
finish before new students arrive this fall.

The front-end is quite simple and could benefit from having historical data
represented with graphs and history going further back than the last 25
readings. The potential for how and what is represented on the website is vast.
When discussing the project with students while we are testing the system some
suggestions keeps reappearing. The most popular is to scan student \textsc{id}
cards to track how much coffee each student drinks, but also tracking who makes
the most coffee or who takes the last cup of coffee and does not start a new
brew, the cardinal sin. The second most popular is to track how many liters of
coffee is consumed and being able to extract fun and interesting data from this.
For example, how much more coffee is consumed during the exam period compared to
a regular day.

\chapter{Licenses}\label{sec:licenses}
Both the code in the back-end and front-end are licensed under the \textsc{mit}
License, a very popular open-source license. The primary reason for choosing
this was due to the very permissive nature of the license, in essence all it
requires is preservation of copyright and license notices. For derivative works
you may freely license them under whatever terms you want and with or without
the aforementioned source code.

The code for the Arduino however required the usage of a library that was
licensed under the \textsc{agpl}v3 license. The family of \textsc{gpl} licenses
are what many call viral licenses, if you use a library in your program that is
licensed under these your program is in essence infected and you now have to
license yours under the same license as well. Hence, this code is licensed under
\textsc{gpl}.

\chapter{API Reference}\label{sec:api-reference}
Our \textsc{api} is a \textsc{rest api}, a stateless web service for making
\textsc{http} requests to endpoints that return data. In our case you can only
ever get data from the \textsc{api}, it only supports \textsc{get} requests. Any
other kind is rejected by the server, therefore there are no security concerns
with the \textsc{api} as you cannot send data to it. There are two types of
requests a user can do, either they can get the latest data, or the last 25 data
points.

A request to our server with the \lstinline{/api/v1/coffee/now} endpoint would
respond with a \textsc{json} object containing the latest reading if the request
is valid:

\lstset{
    string=[s]{"}{"},
    stringstyle=\color{blue},
    comment=[l]{:},
    commentstyle=\color{black},
}
\begin{lstlisting}
{
  "id": 223,
  "measured_at": "2019-04-08T17:42:09.723021+02:00",
  "temperature": 45,

  "brew_outages": "00:00:00"
}
\end{lstlisting}

For users who want to consume our \textsc{api} there is generated an automatic
\textsc{api} reference that is available under \lstinline{/swagger/} that
documents how to connect and use them. For more information, the source code for
the \textsc{api} is available at
